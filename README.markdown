# mtXcontrol - a LED Matrix Editor -

*mtXcontrol* is an editor written in [Processing](http://processing.org) to easily create image sequences for several output devices containing multicolor LED matrix. By now, the [Rainbowduino controller](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/rainbowduino-led-driver-platform-plug-and-shine-p-371.html) and the
[Novation Launchpad](http://www.novationmusic.com/products/launchpad) are supported. Its generic API allows to add other in- and output
devices easily.

*mtXcontrol* Editor auto detects and connects to your device. Once connected, you can draw points, lines &amp; rows in different colors, create multiple frames and manipulate them. Add, delete, move, fill, copy &amp; paste of frames is supported. Play all frames by different speed, realtime update the device and save your work as image file. If supported (e.g. Rainbowduino), update the sequence on your device and run it standalone. One special feature is typing letters and numbers. Future versions aim to support multiple devices, different color depth and many more.

## Requirements:
* Mac/Win/Linux System running Java
* [Novation Launchpad](http://www.novationmusic.com/products/launchpad) OR
* [Rainbowduino + 8x8 RGB LED Matrix](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/rainbowduino-led-driver-platform-plug-and-shine-p-371.html)

If you're using Rainbowduino you'll need to upload firmware:

* [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) 


optional:

* [Processing IDE](http://processing.org/download/)
* [Rainbowduino Processing Library](http://rngtng.github.com/rainbowduino)
* [Launchpad Processing Library](http://rngtng.github.com/launchpad)

## Launchpad HowTo:
Plug your Launchpad and start mtXcontrol. The device is auto detected - start drawing and pushing buttons!!

## Rainbowudino HowTo:
To use your Rainbowduino with mtXcontrol you have to upload the Firmware to your rainbowduino first. [See instruction here](http://www.rngtng.com/2009/06/25/rainbowduino-here-it-is-and-how-to-program-it).  The firmware makes use of the Rainbowduino.h Library to manipulate the Matrix easily. Make sure to put it into your Arduino Library. Connect your Rainbowduino via USB to your computer, upload firmware and you are ready to go - happy mtXcontrol drawing!

### Rainbowduino Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Load the latest Arduino environment on the PC
2. Confirm the ability to upload a simple sketch to the Arduino, making sure to select the correct processor type
3. Upload the "blank" sketch to the Arduino so that it acts like a pass-through connection
4. connect the Rainbowduino to the Arduino as indicated in the [blog picture](http://www.rngtng.com/2009/06/25/rainbowduino-here-it-is-and-how-to-program-it) 
5. Using the Arduino IDE, load the firmware.pde sketch and then transfer it. The Arduino serves as the middle-man so that the microcontroller on the Rainbowduino can be reprogrammed. Important note is to change the processor type to 168 if you have a 328 Arduino.
6. A brand new Rainbowduino should stay blank. now go from displaying the multi-colored test pattern to all white LEDs.
7. Close the Arduino IDE. Load the latest Processing IDE (although similar in appearance, they are not the same). Remember to leave everything connected as displayed in the blog photo.
8. Load the mtXControl application and compile and run it. The display should go blank.
9. Use the application to design your animation. For a preview, switch to 'Device: Slave' mode (alt + ENTER) or second button form top, which displays your drawings in realtime on the Matrix.
10. Then save it to the Matrix.
11. Close the Processing IDE. Disconnect the USB cable from your PC to the Arduino and undo the connections between the Arduino and the Rainbowduino.
12. Power the Rainbowduino up by itself (either with an AC adaptor or a battery) and the animation should display.

## Full list of Features:
* multiple Device support including auto detection
* Draw multicolor points, line and rows (4bit color support)
* Add, delete, clear, fill, *copy &amp; paste*, move frames
* *Draw letters and numbers*, Font configurable
* Save to &amp; load from *Bitmap file*
* Frame preview, easily navigate through
* Keyboard shortcut for each function

Rainbowduino:

  * Standalone Mode or realtime  Update
  * Upload and Download to Matrix *EEPROM* (mind: due to 256kb memory only up to 10 frames). 
  
Launchpad: 
  * full input support to choose color, frame & pixel


## Future ideas:
* Use compression to save more frames to EEPROM - Join discussion [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1606102/arduino-lightweight-compression-algorithm-to-store-data-in-eeprom)
* Font configuration
* Support for multiple Rainbowduinos
* More colors (12bit Support)
* manual device selection
* UI & design updated, (help wanted!!!)
* XBee Support (does this require extra implementations?)
* autoload last sequence from file?
* sequence scripting
* sequence transitions, e.g. scrolling left/right, fading
* sequence backups
* more and updated Docs, screencasts, howtos
* testing!!

## Keyboard shortcuts:
* ENTER - switch between record/play Mode
* <left/right ARROW> - Frame forward/backward (Record Mode) or Speed (Play Mode)
* SPACE - Insert Frame after current Frame
* D - Delete Frame
* X - Clear frame
* F - fill frame
* C+<left/right ARROW> - select previous/next color
* C+ clicking the grid draw in fixed color

* command+S - Save to File (Bitmap)
* command+L - Load File (Bitmap OR text (.mtx))

## Launchpad input:
Top Buttons, Record Mode

* Arrow up - new frame
* Arrow down - delete frame
* Arrow left - previous frame
* Arrow right - next frame
* Session - copy frame
* User1 - insert frame
* User2 - color preview, hold to select
* Mixer - switch to play Mode

Top Buttons, Play Mode

* Arrow left - decrease speed
* Arrow right - increase speed
* Mixer - switch to record Mode

Right Buttons are turn into color chooser when User2 pressed. Blinking button indicates selected color, e.g. full red + full green = yellow. Pushing grid button selects color of pushed button.
